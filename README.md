<b>DroidCam</b> is an open-source experimental camera app for Android. <br>
My goal was to build a simply and basic android camera app with as much functionality and extras i can add.<br>
Other people may found this usefull if they starting from scratch to do something similar.<br>
I have tested this app to around 10 devices only.
